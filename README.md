# Data Structures and Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are essential tools for structuring and organizing datasets, making the analysis and retrieval process faster and more efficient, especially for large datasets. In this project, we focus on two of the most popular and widely used sorting algorithms: **Merge Sort** and **Quicksort**. These algorithms are examined to understand their behavior and performance in a specific geographical dataset. Additionally, we explore the effect of random data arrangements to analyze the complexity and adaptability of each algorithm.
